When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When working with many contribuitors or from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Maybe some other contribuitor pushed changes in the remote that you don't want to get until you finish your local work.
