How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Just looking for the part of the file that has changed since the bug is present.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
By having access to older versions in case you make a mistake.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
Pros: You are able to avoid making redundant versions.
Cons: You need to remember to do them :-)

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because we are dealing with probably complex and numerous files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
With git log you are able to see all the commits in a branch, ans using diff you can view the differences between to commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
By providing you the tools for going back if you make a mistake.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I'd like to try it with my portfolio.
